    <h1>What Is Chess?</h1>
    <p>Chess is a two-player strategy game that has been played for over fifteen centuries. It originated in northern India around the 6th century as a game called <em>Chaturanga</em>, which represented the four divisions of the ancient Indian army: infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots. From India, it spread to Persia where it became known as <em>Shatranj</em>, and after the Islamic conquest, it moved westward into Europe during the Middle Ages.</p>
    <p>Modern chess took shape in the 15th century in Spain and Italy. Today it’s played worldwide—both over the board and online—combining art, science, and sport. The goal is simple yet endlessly complex: to checkmate your opponent’s king.</p>
